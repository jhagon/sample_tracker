CHANGES AND ISSUES
==================
Made a couple of changes to the PDF rendering - the fonts weren't scaling 
correctly on the tear-off slip. The affected subroutine is coshh_summary
which is now like this:

  def coshh_summary

    font_size = 8
    if (@sample.coshh_info)
      if (@sample.coshh_info.split(/\s+/).size +
        @sample.comments.split(/\s+/).size > 50)
        font_size = 5
      end
    end


Changed the wait_time calculation for the sample queue in the file
app/views/samples/queue.html.erb to use the ITEMS_PER_PAGE global
variable.

Make sure that ownership of the entire directory structure is given to user 'nobody'.

When a sample is deleted it seems that the system tries to execute the
'show' action on the just-deleted sample rather than return to the full
samples listing. The code though seems OK!

There are two problems (at least) to do with IE9. One is that the logout link
doesn't work - you must kill the browser to log out. The other problem is
that sample deletes (and possibly other delete operations as well) don't
work. What happens is the user is simply redirected to the 'show' page for
whatever it is that is being deleted. There is a possible solution to this
involving new javascript libraries. See this URL:
