# Sample Tracker Application for Crystallography

This application will provide a framework for the tracking of samples
submitted to the *School of Chemistry Crystallography Service*.
Its features will eventually include:

* user database;
* user categories (e.g. standard and administrative users);
* sample database with submission forms and status flags.
